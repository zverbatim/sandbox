/**
 When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation
 in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at that phenomenon.

 Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century.
 A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up,
 as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).
